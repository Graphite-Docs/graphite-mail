## Mailr

An encrypted list building and email campaign service.

To run locally: 

1. `git clone https://github.com/Graphite-Docs/mailr-client.git`  
2. `cd mailr`  
3. `npm install`  
4. `npm install`  

You will either need to edit the `emailService.js` file and update the server endpoint to simply be Mailr's hosted server, or you can run the server yourself by looking at the [Mailr Server](https://github.com/Graphite-Docs/mailr-server) repository.
